about: >
  <p>Digital teams have embraced increasingly modular design practices as the web continues to become more sophisticated and complex. As more organizations adopt design systems into their culture, understanding how to manage the people working with these systems is more important than ever before. In this course, you will get a high-level overview of how people work with pattern libraries and design systems and learn some strategies for making that process as productive as possible. By the end, you’ll be able to help members of your design and implementation teams work better together and build a successful and well-maintained design system as a result.</p>
