# GYM 11ty

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/655fce6b-0f21-4083-8b06-2d87de788b79/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/gym-11ty/deploys)


### Prerequisites
- [NVM - Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

### Installation
Check to see which version(s) of node you've got installed:
```
nvm list
```

If the list doesn't include the version referenced in `.nvmrc`, be sure to install it:
```
nvm install 18.17
```

Switch to the referenced version:

```
nvm use
```

Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

### Getting Started
Once installed, there are two ways to get this running, depending on your needs.

#### 1. Default
Just run:
```
npm run dev
```
The server will be available at [http://localhost:4040](http://localhost:4040).

#### 2. Running in Parallel with Tutor

This approach uses netlify-cli, which has the advantage of serving up relevant CORS headers, redirects, etc. This useful for running locally in parallel with other applications (such as the Tutor distribution of Open edX).
```
npm run local
```
This command changes sets `NODE_ENV=local` and runs `npx netlify dev`. The server will open a browser automatically to [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888).

Note: Depending on your system, prior to starting up Tutor, you may need to add `127.0.0.1 edly.io` to your `/etc/hosts` file. Once that's done, you should be able to access [http://edly.io:8888](http://edly.io:8888).

This static site generates a JSON feed at `/feeds/config.json`, which is consumed by the various Open edX components - [the theme](https://github.com/gymnasium/gym-theme), the MFEs, and our [customized MFE frontend components](https://github.com/gymnasium/gym-frontend-components).
