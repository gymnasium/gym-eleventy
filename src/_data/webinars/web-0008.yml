<p>
Hiring a one-size-fits-all developer can be a benefit, as well as a hidden cost and compromise to your company and clients.
</p>

<p>
Watch Eric Meyer, web pioneer and author, and Dan Mall, founder and director of design collaborative SuperFriendly, discuss why one size doesnâ€™t always fit all.
</p>

<p class=\"call-out\">
Enjoy the show.
