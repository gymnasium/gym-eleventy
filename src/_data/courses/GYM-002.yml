outline:
  - label: "Chapter 1: Lesson Intro"
    description: A brief introduction to what you'll be learning in the course including how to access and use lesson files.
  - label: "Chapter 2: Installing Node.js"
    description: Walk through the basic steps of installing node onto your system.
  - label: "Chapter 3: Use Node and Express to Serve a Static Directory "
    description: This chapter demonstrates how to use NPM to install the dependencies, and start the server. Additionally, you will learn how to use an HTML file to respond to a HTTP GET request.
  - label: "Chapter 4: Using Express Routes for Handling HTTP GET Requests"
    description: Learn how to set a GET express route, to take your first step for dynamic resource serving.
  - label: "Chapter 5: First Look at Express’ View Engine, with EJS"
    description: You will look at the use of Express' View Engine in two ways, the first is using EJS, a common HTML based renderer, using JavaScript in a method similar to PHP. EJS introduces dynamic rendering without focusing on the syntax learning that Jade requires.
  - label: "Chapter 6: Second Look at Express’ View Engine, with Jade"
    description: The companion piece to Chapter 5, in this chapter you will learn why Jade is one of the most common renderers and will rewrite the EJS example using Jade syntax.
  - label: "Chapter 7: Profile Edit Form with Jade and HTTP Post "
    description: In this chapter you will build an "Edit Profile" form. Along the way you will learn how to retrieve field variables and how to integrate Twitter Bootstrap as well as your custom CSS styles into your Node project.
  - label: "Chapter 8: Read and Write Data from a JSON File"
    description: This chapter demonstrates how you can work with data in Node without the need for a database. Learn how to provide storage for user data in the profile form you created in the previous chapter. Specifically, you will discover how to save and retrieve data in a simple and valid way, using a simple JSON file.
  - label: "Chapter 9: Uploading Images and Storing Reference in JSON Data"
    description: In this chapter, you will conclude the building of your profile form and learn how to retrieve file variables, and manipulate files on the server (in this case the image that a user would upload to a profile form).
