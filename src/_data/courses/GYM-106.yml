about: >
  <p>This course focuses on information graphics and data visualization, a subset of a broader field of information design. You will learn what steps you need to create successful visualizations. Specifically, a survey of the tools of the trade will be covered, everything from mapping tools to charting tools such as D3.js and much more. Additionally, Graham will walk through two real-world examples of visualizations as featured in <cite>The New York Times</cite> and help you get on your way toward making information graphics and visualizations of your own.</p>
outline:
  - label: "Lesson 1: Defining Information Design"
    description: "You will learn the advantages of a visual approach to communication and take a look at the spectrum of the discipline-from infographics to data visualization. Additionally, you will take a look at at the goals of graphics and visualizations with a specific emphasis on journalistic approaches."
  - label: "Lesson 2: Visual Design Principles"
    description: "Learn the basics of visual comprehension including color, proximity, grouping, and more. Also, discover the steps involved with creating an information graphic including how to define focus, gather data, choose form, and how to create a hierarchy of importance."
  - label: "Lesson 3: Interaction Design Principles"
    description: "This lesson will briefly cover the evolution of interactive graphics over the years as well as introduce you to modern interactive techniques including steppers, hovering, sliders, drag and drop, and more."
  - label: "Lesson 4: Tools of the Trade"
    description: "Discover the various techniques used to create infographics and data visualizations, specifically data tools, visualization tools, animation tools and illustration tools."
