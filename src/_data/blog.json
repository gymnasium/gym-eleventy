In particular, large language models (or LLMs) such as<em> </em>ChatGPT and Midjourney have taken the main stage thanks to their ability to understand and generate human language and images. As a professional, you may be wondering: How do LLM tools work? Can I use them in my workflow?

If you’re short on time, read on for a fact-packed summary of the discussion.</p><p><strong>So, what are LLMs?</strong></p><p>In a nutshell, large language models are advanced programs that use artificial intelligence to process and produce human-like language, images, and more. While software is typically programmed with specific, step-by-step instructions, LLMs draw upon a neural network that was trained with a massive dataset that draws on sources like books, code repositories, and the entirety of the web. Through this dataset, the model learns and eventually understands the patterns and relationships between words.</p><p>Even if you’ve never heard of LLMs before today, you’re almost certainly familiar with the way they’re used. Take the autocomplete feature on smartphones, for example. Most of us have had the experience of watching our device predict our next words in real time, but have you ever wondered how it knows what we want to say?</p><p>LLMs are trained on text data, which helps it to learn the patterns and relationships between words. This training allows the tool to predict the most likely word or sequence of words when given a prompt. The model takes the prompt, processes it, and outputs a probability distribution of all possible words. This process repeats as the user continues to type, and the model updates its predictions based on new content and context.</p><p>For instance, imagine you’re texting a friend about food and want to express your love for French fries. Typing out the partial phrase “I love French…” will result in the model calculating the likelihood of your next word through the context of the conversation. It will deduce that there is a higher chance of the next word being “fries” and a lower probability of an unrelated or nonsense word like “movie” or “the.”</p><p><strong>ChatGPT and Midjourney</strong></p><p>Two particular AI platforms, ChatGPT and Midjourney, have taken off thanks to their capacity for taking simple prompts and turning them into unique content. Midjourney can take natural language and convert it into original images, whether you need an illustration for your book or a storyboard to visualize your marketing strategy. ChatGPT, on the other hand, gained notoriety for its uncanny ability to generate natural language. This particular model has been fine-tuned for a seemingly endless number of language production tasks, including summarization, translation, text completion, and even question-answering.</p><p>The way they work is as complicated as you’re likely imagining. The GPT in ChatGPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer, meaning that it creates new content, has been trained for a particular job, and understands context and relationships. The model uses specialized algorithms to find patterns within data sequences, which are then ranked by human trainers to reinforce the best responses and filter out the filler.</p><p>Midjourney operates similarly, with language and diffusion models helping it to understand the meaning of the prompts and produce a distinctive picture. When a prompt is submitted, Midjourney begins with a field of static-esque visual noise that is gradually removed through diffusion. The end result is an image representing the concepts described in the original prompt.</p><p>Notably, ChatGPT has a free version that can be used regardless of what you choose to use it for — whether it’s coding, writing, or even designing a video game. While Midjourney requires a paid subscription, it offers affordable tiers at varying prices.

For developers, however, there’s another way to share and showcase your work: a portfolio.</p><p><strong>Wait, I need a portfolio?</strong></p><p>For job-seekers in the software development industry, an online portfolio is just as important as a cover letter or résumé. Think of a portfolio as the first step in the interview process, representing you and your personal brand. Even if you’re not actively looking for a new role, showing off your skills through a public portfolio comes with a host of benefits. In addition to attracting prospective employers and dream clients, a portfolio helps you exhibit your best work and stand out in an ever-growing sea of experienced developers.

Research suggests that visitors form an opinion about a website in less than one second — and your About page may be the first thing readers click when they visit your portfolio. While there’s no right or wrong way to write this self-summary, the key is to focus on what’s most important to you. Are you an advocate for accessibility? Are you a champion for design systems? Is tweaking web performance your obsession? Are PWAs your passion? Is the JamStack your jam, or are you a PHP nerd? Explain how you got started and why you love it. If you find it difficult to determine exactly what’s important to you, consider your past accomplishments and future goals for inspiration.</p><p>To help readers put a face to your name, it’s recommended that you include a profile photo. A headshot can increase credibility, make your portfolio more memorable, and foster a sense of virtual connection between you and your visitors. In the same vein, incorporating your personality and having fun with your introduction can make it more relatable and engaging. Using an authentic voice, adding in a bit of humor, or dappling your words with a relevant Emoji or two will grab readers’ attention and paint a full picture of who you are as a person.</p><p>Although your About page should serve as a succinct introduction, it can also be helpful to highlight your professional experience with short testimonials or quotes from former employers or colleagues.

That’s the whole point of a portfolio, right? There are many options for conveying this information, including a contact form or a list of personal websites and profiles. However, readers may find it easier if you simply outline one preferred method of contact. It can be a phone number, an email address, or even a WhatsApp username, as long as it’s clear and your potential client can reach you with ease and confidence.</p><p><strong>What else should I include?</strong></p><p>In addition to an About section, your portfolio needs a headline or tagline: a summary of who you are, what you do, and what sets you apart.

In addition to work you’ve created for clients and employers, include any personal projects or experiments you’ve conducted on your own.

Whether you’re actively looking for a new job or considering a career change, it’s one of the first things you’ll be asked to share. Having said that, I’m willing to bet that if you ask 9 out of 10 professionals if they’re happy with the state of their portfolio, the answer will be “No.”</p><p>Chances are high that any given portfolio has one or more of these problems:</p><ul><li>Recent job and/or project history is missing or lacking in details.</li><li>The design of the website is dated.</li><li>The work shown doesn’t accurately represent the type of work you want to do in the future.</li></ul><p>This is not a new problem. But as the Director of Learning for <a href=\"https://thegymnasium.com/\">Aquent Gymnasium</a>, part of my job is to pay attention to trends in the web industry, and I had a hunch that the role of portfolios had changed in recent years. To put this theory to the test, my colleague Justin Gagne (Design Lead) and I developed a pilot portfolio workshop for a small group of designers and developers.</p><p>Going into the workshop, we had a few assumptions about what we would encounter. Some of those assumptions were accurate, but there were a few surprises as well. So I’d like to share those surprises — or as I like to call them “insights” — with you, in the hopes that they will save you some time and effort when you begin to update your own portfolio.</p><h3>Why is it so hard to work on your own portfolio?</h3><p>Before sharing my insights, it’s worth defining our goals for the workshop. We knew that despite understanding the importance of a portfolio, many people felt overwhelmed or blocked from working on them and weren’t quite sure why. To provide structure and help, we had to understand what the specific challenges were.</p><p>Make no mistake, the challenges are real. In fact there’s an old proverb (bordering on cliché) that I’ve heard many web professionals reference over the years which is “The shoemaker’s children go barefoot.” This is generally used as an explanation for why one’s portfolio website has been so neglected.

The role of the portfolio has changed substantially over the years; for example, the days of lugging a physical case of printouts to an interview are long gone.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "If you’re involved in the creation of digital products, you’re aware of the importance of having a portfolio to showcase your work. Whether you’re actively looking for a new job or considering a career change, it’s one of the first things you’ll be asked to share. Having said that, I’m willing to bet that if you ask 9 out of 10 professionals if they’re happy with the state of their portfolio, the answer will be “No.”\nChances are high that any given portfolio has one or more of these problems:\n\nRecent job and/or project history is missing or lacking in details.\nThe design of the website is dated.\nThe work shown doesn’t accurately represent the type of work you want to do in the future.\n\nThis is not a new problem. But as the Director of Learning for Aquent Gymnasium, part of my job is to pay attention to trends in the web industry, and I had a hunch that the role of portfolios had changed in recent years. To put this theory to the test, my colleague Justin Gagne (Design Lead) and I developed a pilot portfolio workshop for a small group of designers and developers.\nGoing into the workshop, we had a few assumptions about what we would encounter. Some of those assumptions were accurate, but there were a few surprises as well. So I’d like to share those surprises — or as I like to call them “insights” — with you, in the hopes that they will save you some time and effort when you begin to update your own portfolio.\nWhy is it so hard to work on your own portfolio?\nBefore sharing my insights, it’s worth defining our goals for the workshop. We knew that despite understanding the importance of a portfolio, many people felt overwhelmed or blocked from working on them and weren’t quite sure why. To provide structure and help, we had to understand what the specific challenges were.\nMake no mistake, the challenges are real. In fact there’s an old proverb (bordering on cliché) that I’ve heard many web professionals reference over the years which is “The shoemaker’s children go barefoot.” This is generally used as an explanation for why one’s portfolio website has been so neglected. After all, if one is busy working on other people’s projects, that leaves little time and energy to work on your own.\nThere’s some validity to this, it definitely is easier to postpone your own project than it is to postpone one for a client or your regular job. After all, those pay the bills and one needs to be pragmatic.\nBut there are a few other reasons why working on your portfolio is difficult:\n\nOne of the most challenging aspects is deciding what to include. Web professionals typically work on many projects in any given year, but not all of them may be relevant or appropriate to showcase in a portfolio, sometimes there are even legal reasons: for example many companies have NDAs (nondisclosure agreements) which prohibit the sharing of visuals or projects done while under contract or while employed.\nPeople also have trouble deciding which projects best represent their skills and abilities, and this often leads to avoidance or focussing on the wrong things, such as taking a week to look for “the perfect” typeface or color scheme for their site.\nAnother challenge is figuring out how to organize and present one’s projects while finding the right balance between showcasing the work and providing context and explanation.\n\nWhen you add all of these challenges up, not to mention the fact that you have no project manager looking over your shoulder, it’s not surprising that portfolios get neglected. There’s also the question of motivation. If you’re happy and comfortable in your current gig, why burn extra calories on nights and weekends to do something that feels difficult? The problem is when circumstances change, if you suddenly need an up-to-date portfolio and you’re doing it under financial stress or time pressures, you’re now making a hard job even harder.\nContent truly is king\nOur original plan for this workshop was quite ambitious and included sessions on using mood boards and Figma prototypes to head in the direction of visual design.

Which is exactly why we asked them. By directing their focus to these difficult questions and giving them some tools to answer them, we helped attendees avoid the common trap mentioned earlier: namely the tendency to get distracted when faced with “the hard stuff.”\nDIY Tip: You don’t have to be part of a workshop to work this way.

(Illustration based on Microsoft’s Inclusive Design visual language.)</figcaption></figure><p>In today’s world of technology, there’s no denying the need for accessibility in all its forms. So how can we get there? To help answer this question, we spoke with<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/about/\">Aaron Gustafson</a>, instructor of Gymnasium’s free <a href=\"https://thegymnasium.com/courses/GYM/107/0/about\">Modern Web Design</a> course and Principal Strategist on Microsoft’s Accessibility Innovation Team.</p><p>In addition to leading the <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-accessibility\">AI for Accessibility</a> grant program, which works to improve independence for those with disabilities by funding the development of new assistive technologies, Gustafson works to identify and invest in technological advancements that improve access for everyone across the board.</p><p>But before we dive into the process of improving user experiences for all, it’s crucial to define and understand the scope of accessibility.</p><p><strong>💭 What is Accessibility?</strong></p><p>In the realm of digital technology, the term “accessibility” is used to describe the extent to which the devices, systems, and tools we use to work and communicate are usable for all. More specifically, the W3C states in the latest edition of the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21\">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a> that all web content should be perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust for every user.</p><p>“When I first learned about accessibility, I only thought of it as making the web usable to people with screen readers… but I’ve come to understand how broad accessibility truly is,” Gustafson said. “To me, accessibility is doing everything we can to remove the barriers that prohibit people from being able to meaningfully participate and thrive in the world.”</p><p>According to CDC data, 15% of the world’s population has a disability, and of those affected by disability in the U.S., 5% are blind or visually impaired while 6% are deaf or hearing impaired. It’s important to recognize that these numbers are likely much higher in reality, as many who live with a disability don’t self-identify as such.</p><p>Designers and developers take these differing experiences and capabilities into account when creating accessibility-focused features, which can be as simple as the ability to zoom in on a portion of text or as complex as text-to-speech software that dictates the content of images and videos. No matter the objective, their overarching goal is to ensure universal access regardless of user abilities.</p><p><strong>⚡ Current Challenges and Solutions</strong></p><p>In addition to the W3C guidelines, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires websites, mobile apps, and other types of software and digital content to be accessible for all. Despite the mandate, some of the world’s most renowned tech companies continue to underestimate the need for accessibility. For example, Twitter recently launched a Voice Tweets feature without captions. The problem doesn’t end with the big names, either: <a href=\"https://webaim.org/projects/million/#errors\">96.8%</a> of all home pages have at least one <a href=\"https://www.boia.org/blog/the-5-most-common-website-accessibility-issues-and-how-to-fix-them\">accessibility error</a>. As a starting point, brands and businesses need to become more aware of accessibility needs within their customer base.</p><p><strong>“</strong>Ultimately, the issue is awareness,” Gustafson explained. “The vast majority of web folks don’t understand the importance of accessibility because even the most basic level of testing isn’t even on their radar.”</p><p>So how can we raise consciousness and make accessibility a core tenant of development and design?</p><p>“Better education in business schools, computer science and design programs, and developer bootcamps would go a long way,” Gustafson said. “Societal awareness is another big factor. This is why it’s so important to see people with disabilities accurately represented in media, like television and movies… I think most people, once aware of the barriers they’re erecting, will want to change the ways they do business, design, program, and generally conduct their lives to ensure more people are included.”</p><p><strong>👩🏽‍💻 Making Tech More Accessible</strong></p><p>Although there are many ways to work towards accessibility in tech, one popular strategy among larger companies is the use of Accessibility Overlays. This software is designed to automatically detect and fix accessibility problems at a mass scale using artificial intelligence. While the idea of an instant solution is appealing, its effectiveness pales in comparison to in-depth individualized fixes.</p><p>“It’s akin to a home renovation in which you see that there’s a big hole in the wall and, rather than properly replace and mud in a fresh piece of drywall, you just wallpaper over it,” said Gustafson. “Adding an overlay does not solve your website’s fundamental accessibility problems. Those problems are a result of the non-inclusive business, design, and development processes. We should be thinking about how to build inclusive products from the jump.”</p><p>Rather than taking the easy way out, Gustafson recommends that companies invest in new tools and training for their teams on how to diagnose and remediate specific accessibility issues. There are a number of valuable free resources available, including browser plugin <a href=\"https://accessibilityinsights.io/docs/web/overview/\">Accessibility Insights</a>, which is able to diagnose problems such as color contrast and missing labels that can be detected programmatically. Whether you start small or go big, this investment in your team will make them “aware of the ways they erect barriers to accessibility so they naturally avoid making those mistakes.”</p><p>“Accessibility work is important and has a tremendous impact on our society. Designing and building accessible experiences ensures our products and services can reach more people, which also impacts a company’s bottom line,” said Gustafson. “Whether you want to look at it from the altruistic perspective of working to empower your fellow human beings or you want to focus on the success of your business, accessibility is something you should be investing in.”</p><p>Inspired to take the next step towards ensuring accessibility for all?

We should be thinking about how to build inclusive products from the jump.”\nRather than taking the easy way out, Gustafson recommends that companies invest in new tools and training for their teams on how to diagnose and remediate specific accessibility issues. There are a number of valuable free resources available, including browser plugin Accessibility Insights, which is able to diagnose problems such as color contrast and missing labels that can be detected programmatically. Whether you start small or go big, this investment in your team will make them “aware of the ways they erect barriers to accessibility so they naturally avoid making those mistakes.”\n“Accessibility work is important and has a tremendous impact on our society. Designing and building accessible experiences ensures our products and services can reach more people, which also impacts a company’s bottom line,” said Gustafson. “Whether you want to look at it from the altruistic perspective of working to empower your fellow human beings or you want to focus on the success of your business, accessibility is something you should be investing in.”\nInspired to take the next step towards ensuring accessibility for all? Gymnasium’s Accessibility Content Collection is chock-full of courses, tutorials, webinars, and articles to get you up to speed on web standards, best practices, and guidelines.

Only half of people around the world are familiar with the concept, and even fewer can define it. Despite this, it’s evolved from a trending topic to a permanent fixture in the modern digital world, with major brands such as Facebook, now Meta, and Microsoft already exploring opportunities to introduce this new arena to their audiences. But what exactly is it — and what does it take to become a part of this growing virtual universe?</p><p><strong>🔮 Defining the digital future</strong></p><p>In essence, the metaverse is a shared virtual space powered by the Internet and enhanced through extended reality (XR) technologies like virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). It has the potential to facilitate meaningful, multidimensional user interactions and experiences by integrating the physical and digital worlds. Whether you want to talk to new friends from across the world, browse real or virtual products, or even build your own house from the ground up, it can all be done in the metaverse.</p><p>It may be a recent trending topic, but the metaverse isn’t actually a contemporary concept. Unsurprisingly, its origins are rooted in science fiction, namely the 1984 novel <em>Neuromancer</em> by William Gibson and the 1992 book <em>Snow Crash </em>by<em> </em>Neal Stephenson. Gibson’s work introduces the concept of an interactive cyberspace known as “the matrix,” while Stephenson actually describes a virtual world called “the metaverse” (yes, he coined the term three decades ago). In Stephenson’s metaverse, users could pick an animated avatar to represent them, attend simulated events like live concerts, and even buy digital property. Sound familiar? Thirty years later, this idea of a 3D online universe has morphed from a geeky fantasy to a tangible, albeit virtual, reality.</p><p>Before the metaverse took form as a virtual world, there was also Second Life’s debut in 2003. Similar to the modern day metaverse, it was created as a venue for escapism and leisure. Users logged in to create intricate “second lives,” with some even marrying other players and raising families within the online platform. As Second Life grew, its experience evolved from fun fantasy into something more true to life with the introduction of property ownership rights, an in-world currency, and the ability to buy and sell goods.</p><p>Much like its unintentional prototypes, the modern-day metaverse is essentially a 3D version of the web — but that’s only the tip of the iceberg. Metaverse proponents see the space as somewhere you’ll be able to develop and live your digital life parallel to the physical world, especially when it comes to developing and fostering relationships. Through the power of VR and AR, casual interactions and conversations can become highly immersive and reminiscent of real life.</p><p>Beyond the commercial hype of <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/02/16/1080671357/looking-good-in-the-metaverse-fashion-brands-bet-on-digital-clothing\">virtual fashion</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/features/shopping-in-the-metaverse-could-be-more-fun-than-you-think/\">shopping experiences</a>, the technologies behind the blurred lines of the metaverse have the potential to redefine online interactions as much closer to the experience of doing so in person. In the words of Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta (formerly known as Facebook), the metaverse’s defining quality is “its feeling of presence, like you are right there with another person or in another place.”</p><p>So, how exactly does the metaverse cultivate the feeling that social media corporations have been trying to capture for over a decade? The difference lies in the various XR technologies that make the metaverse possible, specifically the combination of VR and AR.</p><p><strong>🐝 Breaking down the buzzwords</strong></p><p>The metaverse is designed to change the way that we consume content, transforming it from flat 2D to a fully immersive and dynamic 3D environment. This experiential metamorphosis wouldn’t be possible without XR, VR, and AR — three powerful technologies and hot topics that are often confused for one another. While they’re similar in effect, it’s important to understand the differences between what they can do, especially in the context of the metaverse.</p><p>XR encompasses both VR and AR, and it also includes MR (mixed reality) which combines real and virtual elements to create an entirely new world. VR’s value lies in its ability to produce a computer-generated, 3D space that users can interact with and explore. It’s come a long way from the clunky arcade helmets of the ’90s and early aughts, with sleek, sophisticated systems from brands such as Oculus and Google becoming accessible to the mainstream. These headsets provide 360-degree views and include motion-tracking sensors to blend physical and virtual reality. This technology and its sensory synchronicity allows the user to feel as though they’re part of the virtual environment, giving the metaverse the sense of presence that Zuckerberg touts.</p><p>For a different kind of interactive experience, AR takes elements of the real world and creates a new dimension by adding sound, images, or other stimuli — think Pokémon GO and branded Snapchat filters. In the metaverse, this might involve utilizing GPS data to personalize your surroundings or superimposing components of your actual environment into the landscape of a video game.</p><p>It’s important to underscore that to achieve a true XR, VR, or AR experience, users must be able to naturally interact with the virtual content. This level of immersion is what places the practice in a different category than everyday 3D movies and simulations, making way for the metaverse and its corresponding technologies to become the new digital frontier.</p><p><strong>😎 Get immersed in the metaverse</strong></p><p>To explore this new virtual world, all you really need is an Internet connection. While VR glasses can allow for a more three-dimensional encounter, there are multiple metaverses currently accessible online and offering a wide variety of free opportunities for all, regardless of your equipment or experience.</p><p>If you’re looking for fun in the metaverse, you should start with <a href=\"https://www.urnowhere.com/\">Nowhere</a>. Chatting face-to-face with friends, interacting with performers at live shows, and even partying in a packed nightclub are possible in the space that brands itself as the “metaverse for entertainment.” <a href=\"https://spatial.io/\">Spatial</a>, a social and cultural meeting space in the metaverse, also hosts a wide array of events including lectures, private gatherings, concerts, and user-curated art galleries with purchasable paintings.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "In the words of Gymnasium instructor Brad Frost, design systems are “the official story of how an organization designs and builds products.” They serve as living libraries of essential coding and design elements, from standards and guidelines to patterns, with the aim of simplifying and streamlining the ever-complex product creation and adoption process.\nBy outlining a consistent, overarching design system, those involved in the design and development find themselves producing higher quality work with less time and effort wasted. As an added bonus, this type of structured documentation on the backend can result in a more consistent and cohesive user experience on the front end.\nDesign systems play an undeniably crucial role in bringing order to the chaos of code and design, but building and maintaining a thriving one can be daunting. Not sure where to begin? Gymnasium recently launched four free courses, taught by the one and only Ethan Marcotte, that tackle the topic from a variety of perspectives.\n🎨 Are you a web or UX designer?\nThe growing ubiquity of design systems has had a major impact on designers and the way that they work alongside their teams, and a comprehensive understanding of these systems is more important than ever. In the Design Systems for Designers course, you’ll learn to build a design system from the ground up. With a focus on design, you’ll tackle the differences between pattern libraries and design systems, learn to extend the use of familiar tools like Figma, Sketch, and Adobe Creative Cloud, and discover next steps to elevate and advance your design system work.\n⚙️ Do you code or consider yourself a developer?\nDevelopers can play an integral part in both maintaining and shaping design systems, especially when it comes to the creation and organization of pattern libraries and other reusable components. With Design Systems for Developers, you’ll go beyond the basics to learn the “how” and “why” of design systems, review and practice methods for creating and integrating patterns into a production environment, and define the shape and structure of your own design system.\n📈 Are you a product manager or owner?\nEven if you don’t work directly with design systems, it’s helpful to understand their purpose, how your team works with them, and how you can help to create a successful one. Design Systems for Product Managers provides a high-level overview of design systems and pattern libraries, including common assumptions and problems, how to define your system’s purpose and principles, and ways to improve design system adoption and relevance.\n🤓 Not in the above groups, but want to learn more about design systems?\nYou don’t have to be a designer or developer to take a deep dive into the world of design systems. Design Systems for Everyone outlines the fundamentals of design systems, from the concept’s definition and history to best practices for creating your own.\nDesign systems are here to stay, so think ahead now and thank yourself later.

The use of colors of a similar hue and intensity, known as low contrast colors, can prevent people with visual impairments from reading text or viewing content on a website. When we talk about contrast between colors, we’re mainly referencing the numerical ratio assigned to the difference in light between a given foreground and background.

WCAG’s minimum success criterion, <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html\">SC 1.4.3</a>, dictates the lowest color contrast that is considered accessible. These guidelines say that normal-sized text, including pictures of text, requires a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 while larger text (18px/1.5em or larger, or if bolded, 14px/1.2em or larger) needs a contrast ratio of at least 3:1.

As the nation’s coal industry has collapsed, Kentucky in particular has been hit hard; this past spring, coal jobs in the state fell to the lowest level since 1898. Left behind by the fall of coal production and the changing job market, the former mine workers at Bit Source in Pikeville, Kentucky upgraded their skill sets by learning app, game, software, and web programming and design.

    "content:encoded": "<p><strong>What Are Ad Blockers?</strong></p><p>Ad-blocking software is known for its ability to automatically remove unwanted online advertisements, including, but not limited to, web banners, embedded audio and video, and pop-up windows. In most cases, this is achieved by either interrupting the connection between content providers and third-party ad networks or blocking tracking scripts that follow user web activity. This type of content-filtering software debuted <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/interview-with-the-inventor-of-the-ad-blocker-henrik-aasted-srensen-2015-7\">in the early 2000s</a> after the rise of the Internet, and in the years since, it has steadily made its way into the mainstream.</p><p><strong>Why Do People Want to Block Ads?</strong></p><p>As of 2016, over <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/how-many-people-use-ad-blockers-depends-whom-you-ask-2384864\">70 million people</a> actively use ad blockers on their desktop computers, laptops, smartphones, and tablets in the United States alone. The majority are simply fed up with the high amount of annoying advertisements that disrupt their daily browsing experience. A recent <a href=\"https://research.hubspot.com/reports/why-people-block-ads-and-what-it-means-for-marketers-and-advertisers#LINK1\">study</a> revealed that the most hated types of advertising are full-page web pop-ups, autoplay audio and video Internet ads, and online video pre-rolls, while the most favored formats are unobtrusive kinds like billboards and magazine ads. This reaffirms what most already know — no one likes to be interrupted.</p><p>Many are also attempting to escape ads that increase the load time of their chosen content, decrease the battery life of their device, and increase their data and bandwidth usage, while others are hoping to avoid <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/insights/2014/11/malvertising-is-cybercriminals-latest-sweet-spot/\">malicious ads</a> containing <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2016/01/08/you-say-advertising-i-say-block-that-malware/\">malware</a>, <a href=\"http://inbound360.com/blog/fake-google-adwords-phishing/\">phishing scams</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118480608500871051\">viruses</a>. There are privacy concerns as well, as the vast majority of ad networks and tracking systems <a href=\"http://www.computerworld.com/article/2489106/data-privacy/ad-tracking--is-anything-being-done-.html\">collect information</a> about user behavior. In addition to removing virus-laden pop-ups, ad blockers make it easy to browse anonymously by cutting off these systems.</p><p><strong>What Are the Downsides of Ad Blocking?</strong></p><p>While it’s easy to see the appeal of ad blockers, the software has nearly as many drawbacks as it does advantages. Despite its name, ad blockers often end up blocking more than just advertisements. For example, ad-blocking software automatically blocks Intercom, the in-app messaging tool that we use on <a href=\"https://thegymnasium.com/\">our ad-free platform</a> to provide user support and deliver important notifications. The only way ad-blocking users can access this part of our website is if they whitelist it by adding our URL to their personal inventory of acceptable pages. This content-blocking issue is relatively common; many users of Adblock Plus, the most popular ad-blocking software on the market with over <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2016/01/22/10-years-in-adblock-plus-passes-500-million-downloads/\">500 million</a> downloads worldwide, have complained that the service has inadvertently cut off their access to <a href=\"http://www.pcworld.com/article/3043627/internet/adblock-plus-is-causing-youtube-error-messages.html\">YouTube</a> in addition to <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2015/09/24/iphone-ad-blockers-zap-sites/\">other desired content</a> that is unrelated to advertising.</p><p>Ad-blocking software also has a <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2016/06/08/can-call-truce-war-over-blockers/8tZVojgujMgj1UAKWZZHwK/story.html\">direct effect</a> on websites that host ads, as well as all who earn their livelihoods from the online content industry, including columnists, content creators, editors, and journalists. Many of the pages that we visit daily are only free because of ad revenue, and without it, they will eventually be forced to either shut down or begin charging for access to content. In an attempt to compromise with these websites, Adblock Plus recently debuted an <a href=\"https://adblockplus.org/en/acceptable-ads-agreements\">Acceptable Ads Program</a> which allows publishers to apply to have their ads pre-approved and automatically whitelisted for every Adblock Plus user. In order to qualify, advertisements must meet a list of criteria to be deemed non-intrusive — they must be clearly marked as ads; they must cover less than a quarter of the screen; and they cannot automatically play audio or video — among others.</p><p>This initiative is controversial, however, due to its selectivity (its overall acceptance rate is just <a href=\"https://adblockplus.org/blog/acceptable-ads-by-the-numbers\">9.5</a> percent) and its exception that larger companies with <a href=\"https://adblockplus.org/acceptable-ads#revenue\">over 10 million ad impressions per month</a>, such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, can pay an <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/google-microsoft-amazon-taboola-pay-adblock-plus-to-stop-blocking-their-ads-2015-2\">undisclosed fee</a> to have their ads reinstated. Smaller websites are forced to <a href=\"http://digiday.com/publishers/tough-sell-publisher-turn-off-ad-blocker-messages-polite/\">beg</a> <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2015/08/19/how-some-publishers-ask-readers-to-stop-using-ad-blockers/\">their</a> <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2015/09/12/passive-agressive-ad-blockers/\">readers</a> to manually whitelist their page, although <a href=\"http://blog.pagefair.com/2014/introducing-pagefair-ads/\">research</a> indicates that this tactic is not effective enough to change the behavior of most ad-blocking users. After running over 500 appeals on half as many websites, researchers found that only one-third of all visitors made the effort to utilize the whitelist. Appeals for donations are similarly unpopular: just <a href=\"http://digiday.com/publishers/soft-sell-approach-ad-blocking-doesnt-work/\">three out of one million</a> users obliged when given the option.</p><p><strong>How Can Advertisers Adapt?</strong></p><p>It has been <a href=\"http://digiday.com/publishers/uh-oh-ad-blocking-forecast-cost-35-billion-2020/\">estimated</a> that the use of ad-blockers will cost advertisers 35 billion dollars by 2020, if it continues at its current rate. Some have tried to respond to this epidemic by offering <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-08/wired-is-launching-an-ad-free-website-to-appease-ad-blockers\">ad-free subscription plans</a> for a small fee, but only <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/ad-blocking-walls-not-working-2016-2\">a</a> <a href=\"http://www.computerworld.com/article/2487367/e-commerce/ad-blockers--a-solution-or-a-problem-.html\">fraction</a> of users have been willing to pay up. Others install <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-rise-of-the-anti-ad-blockers-1465805039\">ad blocker blockers</a> that claim to provide a number of solutions, including analytics to measure ad blocking and “ad recovery” to restore advertisements and recapture lost revenue. Unsurprisingly, this attempt at subverting the efforts of customers only drives them further away.</p><p>The best long-term strategy is to solve the underlying problem and focus on creating a better ad experience for dissatisfied users. In this light, many companies have started investing in <a href=\"http://scholarship.law.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3352&amp;context=lawreview\">online</a> <a href=\"http://adage.com/article/digitalnext/effective-native-ads-a-solution-ad-blockers/302476/\">native advertising</a> — ads that are designed to blend in with the content on any given platform.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "What Are Ad Blockers?\nAd-blocking software is known for its ability to automatically remove unwanted online advertisements, including, but not limited to, web banners, embedded audio and video, and pop-up windows. In most cases, this is achieved by either interrupting the connection between content providers and third-party ad networks or blocking tracking scripts that follow user web activity. This type of content-filtering software debuted in the early 2000s after the rise of the Internet, and in the years since, it has steadily made its way into the mainstream.\nWhy Do People Want to Block Ads?\nAs of 2016, over 70 million people actively use ad blockers on their desktop computers, laptops, smartphones, and tablets in the United States alone. The majority are simply fed up with the high amount of annoying advertisements that disrupt their daily browsing experience. A recent study revealed that the most hated types of advertising are full-page web pop-ups, autoplay audio and video Internet ads, and online video pre-rolls, while the most favored formats are unobtrusive kinds like billboards and magazine ads. This reaffirms what most already know — no one likes to be interrupted.\nMany are also attempting to escape ads that increase the load time of their chosen content, decrease the battery life of their device, and increase their data and bandwidth usage, while others are hoping to avoid malicious ads containing malware, phishing scams, or viruses. There are privacy concerns as well, as the vast majority of ad networks and tracking systems collect information about user behavior. In addition to removing virus-laden pop-ups, ad blockers make it easy to browse anonymously by cutting off these systems.\nWhat Are the Downsides of Ad Blocking?\nWhile it’s easy to see the appeal of ad blockers, the software has nearly as many drawbacks as it does advantages. Despite its name, ad blockers often end up blocking more than just advertisements. For example, ad-blocking software automatically blocks Intercom, the in-app messaging tool that we use on our ad-free platform to provide user support and deliver important notifications. The only way ad-blocking users can access this part of our website is if they whitelist it by adding our URL to their personal inventory of acceptable pages. This content-blocking issue is relatively common; many users of Adblock Plus, the most popular ad-blocking software on the market with over 500 million downloads worldwide, have complained that the service has inadvertently cut off their access to YouTube in addition to other desired content that is unrelated to advertising.\nAd-blocking software also has a direct effect on websites that host ads, as well as all who earn their livelihoods from the online content industry, including columnists, content creators, editors, and journalists. Many of the pages that we visit daily are only free because of ad revenue, and without it, they will eventually be forced to either shut down or begin charging for access to content. In an attempt to compromise with these websites, Adblock Plus recently debuted an Acceptable Ads Program which allows publishers to apply to have their ads pre-approved and automatically whitelisted for every Adblock Plus user. In order to qualify, advertisements must meet a list of criteria to be deemed non-intrusive — they must be clearly marked as ads; they must cover less than a quarter of the screen; and they cannot automatically play audio or video — among others.\nThis initiative is controversial, however, due to its selectivity (its overall acceptance rate is just 9.5 percent) and its exception that larger companies with over 10 million ad impressions per month, such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, can pay an undisclosed fee to have their ads reinstated. Smaller websites are forced to beg their readers to manually whitelist their page, although research indicates that this tactic is not effective enough to change the behavior of most ad-blocking users. After running over 500 appeals on half as many websites, researchers found that only one-third of all visitors made the effort to utilize the whitelist. Appeals for donations are similarly unpopular: just three out of one million users obliged when given the option.\nHow Can Advertisers Adapt?\nIt has been estimated that the use of ad-blockers will cost advertisers 35 billion dollars by 2020, if it continues at its current rate. Some have tried to respond to this epidemic by offering ad-free subscription plans for a small fee, but only a fraction of users have been willing to pay up. Others install ad blocker blockers that claim to provide a number of solutions, including analytics to measure ad blocking and “ad recovery” to restore advertisements and recapture lost revenue. Unsurprisingly, this attempt at subverting the efforts of customers only drives them further away.\nThe best long-term strategy is to solve the underlying problem and focus on creating a better ad experience for dissatisfied users. In this light, many companies have started investing in online native advertising — ads that are designed to blend in with the content on any given platform. Popularized by BuzzFeed, online native ads are the modern version of product placement, and, when done right, they are entirely non-intrusive. Most prefer native advertising, and research has shown that it has both twice as much visual focus and a 18 percent higher lift in purchase intent than traditional banner ads. As native ads are also virtually undetectable to ad blockers, this may be the simplest and most effective way for both advertisers and consumers to overcome block shock. By changing the way they market their products and services, advertisers can ensure a higher-quality user experience and eliminate much of the concern and frustration that leads to the use of ad-blocking software in the first place.\nThanks to Milo Goodman for his contribution to this story.\n\nThe Good, the Ad, and the Ugly: the Pros and Cons of Ad Blockers was originally published in Gymnasium on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.",
