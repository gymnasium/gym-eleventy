about: >
  <p>At the end of this course you’ll have a responsive portfolio website you’ve built from scratch. You will learn the essential elements of responsive web design: designing with ﬂexible grids; creating layouts which incorporate typography and fluid media; using CSS media queries; responsive web typography; the Mobile First approach; in-browser design, tools, and resources; and Responsive Web Design workﬂows.</p>
outline:
  - label: "Lesson 1: What Is Responsive Web Design?"
    description: >
      An introduction to Responsive Web Design. We'll explore examples and
      discuss context, but you won't begin coding yet.
  - label: "Lesson 2: Setting The Stage With HTML5 And CSS3"
    description: >
      You will learn the HTML5 and CSS3 syntax that is the most relevant to the
      sample portfolio site that is being used for the course. Coding begins in
      this lesson, and if you’re confident in your HTML5 and CSS3 knowledge you
      could skip to Chapter 3, but be aware that the structural logic of the
      final responsive layout begins here.
  - label: "Lesson 3: Mobile First"
    description: >
      Learn about the Mobile First approach, which forces designers and
      developers to focus on the content and user experience of their websites
      in all contexts. This chapter involves the coding of a single column
      layout designed for the smartphone.
  - label: "Lesson 4: CSS3 Media Queries"
    description: >
      Understand how media queries are used to adjust the design and layout of a
      website as the viewport changes. From a coding perspective you will be
      adding media queries to your single column smartphone layout and setting
      the stage for the eventual fluid grid layout.
  - label: "Lesson 5: Responsive Typography"
    description: >
      The heart of any website is content, and more specifically: text. This
      lesson discusses the challenges of managing the properties of line-height,
      line length, and font-size in a responsive layout. This lesson represents
      a deep dive into the code as you create a baseline grid and typographic
      scale that will serve as a foundation for your page.
  - label: "Lesson 6: Using A Fluid Grid"
    description: >
      Learn about the role of grid layout in web design in general and
      responsive layout in particular. Within the code, you will build upon your
      core mobile layout to create a flexible three-column design with
      consistent gutters.
  - label: "Lesson 7: Responsive Layout: Stay Flexible"
    description: >
      Page components such as tables and forms work well on wider desktop
      screens, but present challenges on the smaller screen. In this lesson you
      will explore how to look for solutions to common layout problems using
      responsive design patterns. You will get a chance to solve one particular
      problem as you integrate a responsive form into your existing design.
  - label: "Lesson 8: Responsive Images"
    description: >
      Learn how to add images that work across the range of devices from the
      smallest phone to the largest high-definition (Retina) displays. In the
      coding example, you will learn a few techniques (including the Picturefill
      technique) that deliver the highest-quality image to your users while
      simultaneously avoiding performance penalties.
  - label: "Lesson 9: Responsive Navigation Methods"
    description: >
      Take a look at the unique challenges and potential solutions involved with
      responsive navigation. In the code, you will get a chance to create a
      responsive toggle menu that conserves space on smaller screens and expands
      to full size when possible.
  - label: "Lesson 10: Optimization And Performance"
    description: >
      When you begin treating performance as another component of design such as
      layout or color, things fall into place. In this lesson, you will identify
      potential performance issues with your site using free online tools and
      then explore ways to optimize your assets to improve performance.
  - label: "Lesson 11: Grid Systems"
    description: >
      Now that you have learned how to build a responsive layout from scratch,
      it’s time to start looking at grid systems as a way to rapidly prototype
      responsive sites and/or begin using a grid system for production. You will
      walk through an overview of popular systems including Zurb Foundation,
      Twitter Bootstrap, and Gridset.
  - label: "Lesson 12: Responsive Web Design Workflow"
    description: >
      Putting it all together, this lesson compares the classic workflow of a
      web designer to that of someone who designs and builds responsively.
      Concepts, tools, and best practices will be discussed. Specifically, you
      will get a quick look at the benefits of using a CSS preprocessor such as
      Sass.
prerequisites:
  - label: "You will be asked to understand and write code to learn and practice responsive techniques with both HTML and CSS."
  - label: "Knowledge of graphic design software: Minimal use of Photoshop, Fireworks, or any graphic design tool may be required to complete lesson assignments."
