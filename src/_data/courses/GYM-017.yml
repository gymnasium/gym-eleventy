about: >
  <p>Working with design systems can be challenging. It involves a lot of consensus-building, learning new skills, and developing new ways of working. As more organizations are integrating design systems into their culture, understanding how to work with these systems is more important than ever before. In this course, you will walk through the process of building a design system from beginning to end with helpful exercises along the way. By the end, you’ll know how to conduct a pattern inventory,  how to evolve a pattern library into an effective design, and how to measure whether your design system is working.</p>
