    description: >
      <p>Being busy is not a bad thing. Not managing your own time is. During this course, you’ll learn how to estimate your time and perhaps more importantly, how to stick to those estimates. There is no silver bullet to make it happen. It’s mostly going to be up to you, but the practices described here should help you keep yourself—and your time—honest.</p>
      <p>Although the techniques in this course can be used by anyone, we focus on creative roles, specifically in web design and development. Topics covered include how to accomplish discrete tasks for research, UX design, visual design, and web development. Additionally we conduct a survey of tools (both “analog” and digital) that will help you track your time and prioritize tasks (to-do lists).</p>
