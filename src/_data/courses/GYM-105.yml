# Begin Overview

about: >
  <p>If you’re looking for a course on how to “spice up” existing content with flowery language, this isn’t it. We’re going to use real data from tools like Google Analytics and Google Keyword Planner to help us make content decisions. Some people might think this is boring and uncreative, but our goal is to be “authentic” rather than “viral,” and rest assured, the two aren’t mutually exclusive — as you’ll soon see for yourself!</p>
  <p>Here are 6 things you’ll get from this course:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Case studies of companies whose content is compelling and builds trust</li>
    <li>Tools for finding the “right” words (Hint: We’ll be researching our audience!)</li>
    <li>How to distill audience research into a Language Board that guides your writing</li>
    <li>A methodology for doing Content-First UX Design for any device</li>
    <li>Practice writing compelling content for email messages and blog posts</li>
    <li>Content, context, and device considerations for desktop versus mobile</li>
  </ul>
outline:
  - label: "Lesson 1: Seeing Content As Conversation"
    description: >
      Train your inner copywriter to begin recognizing Reliable, Authentic, and
      Direct content which we refer to in this course as "Lean Content." We will
      review case studies of companies whose content is compelling and, as a
      result, builds trust. Additionally, we will define the difference between
      Content Strategy and Content Marketing and discuss the importance of how
      to measure engagement and conversions.
  - label: "Lesson 2: Finding The Content Our Customers Want"
    description: >
      To help find the “right” words for your content you need to study your
      customer’s natural (organic) language. Writing content based on the words
      that customers use helps produce content that your customers will respond
      to. We will use Google Analytics to study the analytics of an existing
      website to understand the content customers want. We will use
      Google Keyword Planner to study the keywords customers are using on search
      engines. We will also look at other tools such as organic search results
      and social networks.
  - label: "Lesson 3: Creating A Content Workbook"
    description: >
      A Content Workbook is a simple document (similar to an outline) that
      serves as a content roadmap for your website or mobile project. The
      Workbook incorporates audience research/data, uses the language we want to
      use with customers, and provides real content that will eventually be
      useful for the user experience process. We will walk through the process
      of building a Content Workbook from scratch in Google Docs.
  - label: "Lesson 4: Using Data To Write A Language Board"
    description: >
      A Language Board represents the core conversation that a company wants to
      have with its highest value target customers. It’s built upon the existing
      research and content recommendations and is where “real” content starts to
      be written. We will walk through the process of building a Language Board
      in Google Docs.
  - label: "Lesson 5: Content-First UX Design With Conversation Maps"
    description: >
      A Conversation Map is a text-only representation of an end-to-end
      transaction and includes the messaging a user will see from start to
      finish. From a practical perspective, the Conversation Map becomes the
      labels, callouts and microcopy that your team needs to design and develop
      your website or mobile app. We will build upon the previous lessons and
      build a Conversation Map that will be ready to hand off to developers
      and/or others on a project team.
  - label: "Lesson 6: Making Content-First Design Work In Real Life"
    description: >
      In this lesson, we take a look at how the entire process covered in the
      first five lessons actually works by walking through a case study of the
      Annie E. Casey Foundation. All the concepts introduced in the course
      including the Content Workbook, Language Board, and Conversation Maps will
      be covered in depth.
